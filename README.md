# Social-network-API-MongoDB

![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/CharDige/Social-network-API-MongoDB)

## Description

This project required the creation of a social network API using Express.js, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. The functionality included getting all users and thoughts, getting one user or thought, posting new users and thoughts, updating user and thought information, and deleting users and thoughts. It also required the creation and deletion of friends to attach to users, and reactions to attach to thoughts.

No seed data was provided, so it was also required to create my own data using Insomnia after I created the API.

## User story

```
AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data
```

## Acceptance criteria

```
GIVEN a social network API
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list
```
